Musicbee Lyric plugin DLL

I do not own the copyright. My main purpose here is to provide the compiled DLL file for non-technical users.




STEP1: Build the DLL
1. Download source code from: https://github.com/netsphere-labs/mb_PetitLyricsPlugin
2. Unzip the mb_PetitLyricsPlugin-master.zip
3. Compile the source code with Visual Studio
 

STEP2: Install and Configure
1. Copy mb_PetitLyricsPlugin.dll into C:\Program Files (x86)\MusicBee\Plugins\
2. Change settings in Musicbee accordingly
	- Tab(2):  Activate Petit Lyrics and change the priority order
	- Plugin:  Possibly you don't need to do anything here

STEP3: Clearn up cached lyrics (if you want to download again)
Delete files under C:\Users\(YourName)\AppData\Local\MusicBee\InternalCache\Lyrics\
